            <h1>Purchase</h1>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, currently no convenient method is available for non-Japanese as I have trouble receiving purchase through Paypal:(<br>
                If you can access paypay (not paypal, it's japanese payment service) in any way, you can purchase through it.<br>
                Please follow the instruction in <a href="./K2ge3_ja.html">this Japanese page</a>.<br>
                I'll announce on my Twitter if some other method became available.
